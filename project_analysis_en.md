# Chain-of-Zoom Project Analysis Report

## 1. Project Overview

Chain-of-Zoom is an innovative Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR) project that achieves extreme resolution enhancement through autoregressive scaling and preference alignment. The project aims to address key limitations in existing super-resolution models:

1. Blur and artifact issues when models are pushed beyond their training magnification range
2. High computational costs and inefficiency of retraining models for higher resolutions

## 2. Core Algorithm Analysis

### 2.1 Autoregressive Scaling Chain Algorithm

Chain-of-Zoom's core concept is decomposing extreme super-resolution tasks into a series of smaller magnification steps, each reusing the same base SR model. This process can be represented by the following mathematical formulas:

    B --> C[Intermediate State x₂]
    C --> D[...]
    D --> E[Final Result xₙ]
    
    subgraph "Each Magnification Step t"
        F[["p(xₜ|xₜ₋₁) = SR(xₜ₋₁, cₜ)"]]
    end
    
    subgraph "Conditional Probability Decomposition"
        G[["p(xₙ|x₀) = ∏ᵢ p(xᵢ|xᵢ₋₁)"]]
    end
```
